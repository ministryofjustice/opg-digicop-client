#Contributing to Serve-OPG
The rewrite of Serve-OPG is being used as an opportunity to develop skills in a number of areas that OPG Digital deem to be important. Given the L&D focus of the project the following guidelines are in place to maximise the potential for learning new skills:

- We have a [code of conduct](./docs/runbooks/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) in place which governs contributors behaviour. All participants of the project should actively uphold the code of conduct.
- New code must be written using Golang
- Our issues, tickets and roadmap are in Github - see if an issue already exists before submitting a new one
- Any ticketed work should be tackled as part of a pair following [pairing guidelines](./docs/runbooks/PAIRING.md)
- Code should be written using [Test Driven Development (TDD)](./docs/runbooks/TDD.md)
- PRs should be opened using the [pull request guidelines](./docs/runbooks/PULL-REQUEST-AND-RELEASE-PROCEDURE.md)
